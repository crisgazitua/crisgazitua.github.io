# Web Technologies - Lab 02

In this session you are going to work on the website you created las week and improve it using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

## Instructions

1. Work on the repository you created last week.
2. Edit the website you created last week and implement Bootstrap on it to achieve a responsive user interface. To do so, you have to implement at least [responsive containers](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/containers/#responsive-containers) as well as [columns](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/columns/) for the layout. In designing your site keep in mind that the users that are going to visit it will be using different screen sizes. At least make sure that screen sizes smaller than 768 pixels and smaller than 1200 pixels fit the layout correctly.
3. Pick at least 3 [components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/) from the ones available and implement them in your site.
